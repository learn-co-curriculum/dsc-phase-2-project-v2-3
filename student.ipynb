    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "The real estate market in King County, Washington, which is part of the United States' Pacific Northwest, is vibrant and diverse. The county includes the thriving metropolis of Seattle, which is known for its booming tech sector, quick economic development, and gorgeous natural environs. King County's real estate market has always been characterized by a strong demand for homes, largely due to the presence of significant companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Boeing that bring in a constant stream of workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this increase in demand has also resulted in affordability issues and a lack of homes, especially reasonably priced housing. The need for sustainable, environmentally friendly housing alternatives, urban expansion, and striking a balance between growth and protection of the environment are further challenges facing the King County real estate market. Because of this, there is fierce competition in the local real estate market, with developers, online platforms, and well-known real estate firms fighting for market share. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders in the area must comprehend the dynamics of the King County real estate market in addition to economic indicators, competition, and location-specific elements in order to effectively navigate the opportunities and difficulties posed by this dynamic environment.Property prices are influenced by three main categories of factors: property-specific attributes like location, size, condition, and amenities; market dynamics including supply, demand, interest rates, and economic conditions; and external factors such as neighborhood characteristics and government policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these factors is essential for various real estate stakeholders. Real estate agents need this knowledge to offer accurate pricing recommendations and effective marketing strategies. Homeowners can benefit from it when pricing their properties, and investors and developers can identify promising opportunities and maximize their returns."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate market in King County operates in a highly dynamic environment, where economic conditions, fluctuations in housing demand, and various external factors contribute to its ever-changing nature. In this context, the repercussions of setting inappropriate property prices and making ill-informed selling decisions can be detrimental. Maximizing the selling price of a home demands a deep dive into research and market trend analysis. Key aspects to consider include evaluating property attributes such as location, size, amenities, condition, and their sensitivity to recent market shifts. By dissecting the complex web of relationships between these property characteristics and selling prices, the real estate agency endeavors to empower homeowners with the insights needed to mitigate the risks associated with pricing errors and suboptimal investment choices."
