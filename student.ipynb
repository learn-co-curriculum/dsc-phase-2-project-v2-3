    "### Interpretation fot the Baseline Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Baseline Model is a simple linear regression model that predicts 'price' based on a single independent variable, 'sqft_living.'\n",
    " \n",
    "**R-squared:** - R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (price) that is explained by the independent variable (sqft_living). \n",
    "In this case, approximately 49.7% of the variation in price is explained by the variation in square footage of living space (sqft_living).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coefficients:** - The model's coefficients provide insight into the relationship between 'sqft_living' and 'price.'\n",
    "Intercept: -50,820 (rounded) represents the estimated price when the living space size is zero, which is not practically meaningful. \n",
    "The coefficient for 'sqft_living' is approximately 284.26, indicating that, on average, for each additional square foot of living space, the price of a property is estimated to increase by $284.26.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAE:** - The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 175,229.76 quantifies the average magnitude of the prediction errors. The MAE represents the average absolute difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices in the dataset. A lower MAE suggests a more accurate model, while a higher MAE indicates less accuracy. This MAE is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Significance:** - The model is highly significant, as indicated by the F-statistic with a very low probability value (Prob (F-statistic): 0.00). This implies that the relationship between living space size and price is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition number is large (5.64e+03), which may indicate strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Baseline Model is a useful starting point for understanding how the size of living space affects house prices. It explains nearly half, or approximately 49.7%, of the variability in house prices, signifying a significant relationship. The model is statistically robust and fits the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it's crucial to remain cautious regarding diagnostic tests and potential multicollinearity issues when employing this model for predictive or inferential purposes. While the Baseline Model offers fundamental insights into the impact of living space size on prices, there is room for enhancing predictive accuracy. Addressing potential multicollinearity is a recommended step for improving model performance."

    "\n",
    "**Adjusted R-squared:** The adjusted R-squared value, closely aligned with the R-squared value at 0.702, helps account for the number of predictors, indicating a robust model fit that avoids overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**F-statistic:** The high F-statistic of 2309 demonstrates the overall statistical significance of the model, with a very low probability (Prob (F-statistic): 0.00). This underscores the model's strong explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coefficients:** The coefficients for individual features indicate the magnitude and direction of their impact on house prices. Some features positively influence prices, such as 'bathrooms,' 'sqft_living,' 'floors,' 'waterfront,' 'condition,' and 'grade,' while others, like the number of bedrooms, exert a negative influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intercept:** The intercept term (const) is 9.114e+06, representing the estimated price when all other predictor variables are zero, although it may not hold practical significance given the nature of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The MAE is approximately 127,176.67, representing the average absolute difference between predicted and actual house prices. A lower MAE indicates more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest eigenvalue hints at the potential presence of strong multicollinearity or issues with the design matrix, warranting further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multiple Linear Regression Model demonstrates its strength by effectively explaining a substantial portion of the variance in house prices, as indicated by the high R-squared value. It underscores that numerous features significantly influence house prices, impacting them either positively or negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, it's essential to be mindful of the potential existence of multicollinearity within the dataset, necessitating further investigation to ensure the model's reliability. Furthermore, there are opportunities for improving predictive accuracy by reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) through refining the model and optimizing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this model proves invaluable for unraveling the intricate relationship between diverse factors and house prices. It provides invaluable insights for making well-informed decisions in real estate analysis and price predictions while pointing toward areas for potential enhancements and refinement.\n"
