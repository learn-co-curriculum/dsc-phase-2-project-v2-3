INTODUCTION
This study aims to address the importance of identifying the factors that significantly influence home costs,Because conventional methods rely on anecdotal evidence or limited research, they often yield incorrect findings. This knowledge gap makes it more difficult for stakeholders to predict and assess changes in house prices. To solve this issue, we are using multiple regression modeling techniques to thoroughly analyze home sales data. Multiple regression is a useful tool for analyzing the relationship between different attributes and home sales prices since it takes into consideration the combined impact of several independent variables.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
Real estate valuation poses significant challenges for Rittenhouse Brothers, particularly when determining property values influenced by unique features and the impact of renovations or upgrades. The subjective nature of valuation, varying interprations among appraisers and professionals, and the absense of a purely objective methodology contribute to vakuation discrepancies.

MAIN OBJECTIVE
This Analysis aims to establish an objective property valuation model, focusing specifically on Property Unique features and the impact of renovations or upgrades. The primary goal is to minimize variations in valution estimates and provide Rittenhouse Brothers with a more standardized and reliable method for assessing property values.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover connections between various variables and the target variable. This process aids in identifying pertinent variables for inclusion in a regression model.

Create a multiple regression model to forecast house sale prices by taking into account chosen independent variables and examining their influence on the dependent variable. Validate the model assumptions, evaluate its fitness for the data, and refine the model as needed.

Analyze the coefficients of the independent variables within the model to discern their individual contributions to house prices. Identify the most impactful factors influencing house sale prices and delineate their respective effects.

Assess and confirm the efficacy of the model.

Offer practical insights and recommendations derived from the analysis to aid Rittenhouse Brothers in making well-informed decisions related to property investment.

METHODOLOGY

RESULTS AND INTERPRATATION
Based on the correlation matrix, and correlation heatmap, and the model results for the standardised data, squarefoot living variable is the sigle most signficant variable in affecting house prices, then followed by view based on our model.

For house with average 'sqft_living', 'floors', 'condition', and 'view', the house price is about 540,500 dollars. A unit increase in square feet of sqft_living leads to a $253.5 increase in house price. While our models explain 54.3 percent of the variablity in house prices, its error increases with increasing shouse price as seen in the residual plot
